# OpenCVSample
This is a simple OpenCV project for me to figure out how all this stuff works. SO far I have gotten the following to work.

- Face detection
- face blurring
- ANPR camera including OCR and RDW(dutch DMV) lookup of the license plate data


To use it please first follow https://docs.opencv.org/2.4/doc/tutorials/introduction/java_eclipse/java_eclipse.html#java-eclipse to see how to setup opencv
